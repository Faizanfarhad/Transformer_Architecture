**Project Overview**

This repository implements Encoder Transformer-based sentiment classifier (training pipeline and notebook examples). The core experiment lives in [EncoderBlock.ipynb](EncoderBlock.ipynb) which shows data preparation, model definition, training loop, and evaluation.

**Note**: While interacting with [EncoderBlock.ipynb](EncoderBlock.ipynb) , you dont need to install the dataset it will load the dataset in main memory after running the third cell ,There  is decoder Architetcure is available because i forked this repo from someone so it contain the decoder layer but it is in previous versions of the pytorch and  other library that needs to be updated ,i dont have use for the decoder architechture so i didnt bother to update it , i just update the layer of the encoder architecture according to my needs and add some extra logic to build an sentiment analysis model  

**Quick Start**
- **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Run notebook:** open [EncoderBlock.ipynb](EncoderBlock.ipynb) and run cells in order to reproduce training and evaluation.  
- **Main model files:** see [models/model/encoder.py](models/model/encoder.py) and [models/embeddings/transformer_econding.py](models/embeddings/transformer_econding.py).

**Model Flow**
- **Input:** tokenized `input_ids` (shape (B, T), dtype `torch.long`).  
- **Embedding:** token + positional embeddings → (B, T, d_model) (float).  
- **Encoder stack:** a sequence of `EncoderLayer` modules that process float embeddings and preserve shape (B, T, d_model).  
- **Pooling & Classifier:** after the final encoder layer, pool (mean over non-pad tokens or use a CLS token) and run a single linear classifier to obtain logits (B, num_classes).

**Layers — What They Do**
- **Token & Positional Embeddings:** map integer token indices to float vectors. See [models/embeddings/token_embeddings.py](models/embeddings/token_embeddings.py) and [models/embeddings/positional_encoding.py](models/embeddings/positional_encoding.py).
- **EncoderLayer:** attention + feed-forward block that inputs and outputs float tensors (see [models/blocks/encoder_layer.py](models/blocks/encoder_layer.py)).
- **ClassifierHead:** a simple `nn.Linear` from `d_model` → `num_classes` (see `ClassifierHead` in [EncoderBlock.ipynb](EncoderBlock.ipynb)).

Important constraint: embeddings must receive integer index tensors (`torch.long`). Do not call `nn.Embedding` on float tensors — that causes the RuntimeError: "Expected tensor for argument #1 'indices' ... but got torch.cuda.FloatTensor instead."

**Why you might see shape/dtype errors**
- Passing encoder outputs (float, shape (B,T,d_model)) into `CrossEntropyLoss` directly will fail because the loss expects logits shape (B, num_classes). Make sure to call the classifier on pooled encoder outputs before computing loss.  
- If you see an embedding-type error, check `input_ids.dtype` and where `nn.Embedding` is called.

**How to Collect Layer Outputs (optional)**
- To inspect intermediate representations, collect each layer output into `hidden_states` and optionally `torch.stack(hidden_states)` to get shape (n_layers, B, T, d_model). This is useful for analysis or auxiliary losses but increases memory usage.
- Memory-saving option: pool each layer (B, d_model) and store (B, n_layers, d_model) instead of full (B, T, d_model).

**Fixing Overfitting — Contribution Guide**
- **Diagnostics:** first check training vs validation loss/accuracy curves (notebook already collects `train_losses`, `val_losses`). If training accuracy is much higher than validation accuracy, overfitting is likely.
- **Quick fixes to try:**  
	- Increase dropout (`drop_prob`) in embedding/encoder layers.  
	- Use weight decay (the code already supports `weight_decay` in AdamW).  
	- Reduce model capacity: decrease `d_model`, `n_layers`, or `d_ff`.  
	- Add early stopping or limit epochs.  
	- Use data augmentation or more training data.  
	- Use gradient clipping and lower learning rate or a different LR schedule.
- **Where to change:** most hyperparameters live in `conf.py` and the model initializers in [EncoderBlock.ipynb](EncoderBlock.ipynb) and [models/model/encoder.py](models/model/encoder.py).
- **To contribute a fix:** open a PR that includes (a) a short description, (b) a notebook cell or test that reproduces the issue and shows improvement, and (c) code changes. Add tests or a short training script demonstrating reduced val loss.

**Directories — What `EncoderBlock.ipynb` Uses**
- Used by the main notebook and model: [models/](models/) and its subfolders: [models/embeddings](models/embeddings), [models/blocks](models/blocks), [models/model](models/model).  
- Utility helpers used: [util/](util/) for tokenizers and data loading.  
- Checkpoints are saved under: `saved_model/` (used to save/load weights).

**Directories Structure**
-[`encoder_layer.py`](models/blocks/encoder_layer.py)] : for the Full Encoder Block  
-[`multihead_attention.py`](models/layers/multihead_attention.py)] : for the implementation of the MultiHead Attention Layer
-[`add_norm.py`](models/layers/add_norm.py)] : for the implementation of the Add&Norm Layer
-[`positionwise_feed_forward.py`](models/layers/positionwise_feed_forward.py)] : for the Implementation of the FFN layer 

**Directories You Can Reuse / Extend**
- Some folders are present but not required directly by `EncoderBlock.ipynb`. These are useful places to add features or experiments:  
	- `Refrence/` — example notebooks you can port improvements from.  
	- `images/` — visuals for README / analysis.  
	- Any other project folders not referenced in `EncoderBlock.ipynb` are fine places to add upgrade utilities (data augmentation, monitoring scripts, alternative model variants).

**How to Contribute**
- Fork the repo, make a branch, implement changes, add a short notebook cell showing before/after metrics, and open a PR. In the PR description, explain whether the change targets overfitting (hyperparams, architecture, regularization) or model correctness (dtype/shape fixes).

**Contact / Notes**
- If you run into dtype or shape errors, verify the tensor shapes and dtypes at the embedding and loss boundaries: print `input_ids.shape, input_ids.dtype` before embedding and `encoder_out.shape` before pooling/classifier.

Thanks — contributions welcome!
